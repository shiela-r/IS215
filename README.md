Web app for making news article (fictional) from photos.
This web application was created for the IS215 course to turn photos into image labels, and then to  fictional news articles. AWS Rekognition was used for analyzing uploaded images to identify labels such as objects, scenes, and actions. These identified labels then are sent to GPT-3.5-turbo, which generates news article. The uploaded image and the article are displayed on results page.
Images in JPG or PNG format can be uploaded by users. Each image is stored securely in an S3 bucket.  A Lambda function is triggered once the image is stored and the the image is processed using Rekognition. This function generates labels from the image and submitted them as input to GPT-3.5-turbo to generate articles.
A `.env` file is used to store API keys and sensitive data. This file must be kept out of the repository. The setup involves configuring the S3 bucket to trigger the Lambda function and deploying the function using the `rekogopenaiautomatic_v2.py` script. The function sends the detected labels to GPT-3.5-turbo, which returns a fictional news article based on the labels.
